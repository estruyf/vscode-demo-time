I must admit, creating great demos can be time-consuming, and definitely when it's your first time.

Over the past two years, I built **Demo Time** to help presenters script, automate, and deliver better presentations and demos without the stress. Developers, advocates, and trainers are already using it to avoid the classic demo pitfalls: frantic window switching, broken commands, tiny fonts, and lost flow.

But there was always one missing piece: **creating the demo itself still took too much time.**

I decided it was time to change that.

## The challenge: why demos take so much time

When I talk to people who present regularly, they almost always describe the same friction points. I know I've felt them myself.

It is not just frustration; it is lost time. **On average, a high-quality 15-minute technical demo takes 15-20 hours to build and refine.** That is two full days of lost engineering or sales time per demo.

- **Maintenance:** You update your product or feature, and suddenly the old demo no longer works.
- **Narrative:** You want to tell a clear story, but you aren't sure which commits or changes matter most.
- **Organization:** Your notes are scattered everywhere.
- **Starting from scratch:** You lack templates, so every demo feels like Day 1.
- **Fine-tuning:** You spend hours tweaking code steps, commands, and highlights.
- **Anxiety:** The pressure of “will the demo break on stage?” never fully disappears.

Demo Time solves the *delivery* part. Now, I want to help solve the *creation* part.

## The solution: Demo Time as a Service

This new offering is designed to help you create high-quality, reusable, and low-stress demos significantly faster.

It consists of three core pillars:

### 1. Slide themes and templates

Stop reinventing the wheel. Reusable templates let you start with a polished foundation immediately.

This includes:
- Professional slide themes
- Pre-built animation sets
- Slide and code flow templates
- Structures for typical product walkthroughs
- Best practices for timing and narration

> **Price point**: Affordable one-time purchase.

### 2. Expert coaching

If you need one-on-one assistance, I now offer hands-on guidance to elevate your presentation.

This includes:
- Reviewing and auditing your existing demos
- Rewriting complex sections for clarity
- Improving flow, timing, and impact
- Structuring your narrative for your specific audience
- Creating reusable assets for your team

> **Price point**: Hourly rate is € 200 / hour.

### 3. The demo creation service

This is the most exciting part.

I have been experimenting with a system that generates demos **directly based on your commit history**.

Imagine this workflow:
1. You tell the service which feature you want to present.
2. The system analyzes your commits, PRs, diffs, and context.
3. It identifies the critical steps.
4. It generates a demo script that matches your story.
5. Demo Time renders that script into presentation-ready steps.

This is fundamentally different from screen recording tools or generic slide builders. Because it is tied to your git history, your demo remains a living part of your codebase, not a static artifact that rots the moment you merge a new PR.

The long-term vision is a fully automated service that does the heavy lifting for you.

> **Price point**: pay-per-use model (e.g., € 500 per generated demo).

## Who is this for?

This service is built for:
- Developer Advocates
- Product Engineers
- Solution Architects
- Sales Engineers
- Teachers and Trainers
- Anyone who has ever said: *“I know what I want to show, I just don't have the time to build the demo properly.”*

## Enterprise offering: build with confidence

If your company depends on demos for sales, onboarding, education, or internal communication, Demo Time as a Service can scale your efforts.

**Benefits include:**
- Faster creation of consistent, on-brand demos
- Reusable demo libraries shared across teams
- Reduced presenter stress and fewer "demo fails"
- Predictable structures for product walkthroughs
- Optional on-site consulting
- Priority access to automated demo generation features
- **Dedicated support channels** for your team

## No hype, just commitment

Don't get me wrong, this is an early offering. I am checking if there is a genuine interest and need for this, as I believe that this tool makes technical presentations so much easier and gives confidence to all speakers.

The automated system begins manually so I can learn from real-world usage. Once the workflow is stable, the goal is a fully automated experience powered by AI and deeply integrated with Demo Time.

I want to build this openly with your input.
