## Article structure

Each article is created in their own folder under `src/content/articles`, and the main content is written in a Markdown file named `index.md`. This structure helps keep things organized and makes it easy to add new articles.

### Frontmatter

Each article should start with a frontmatter section that includes the following fields:

- `title`: The title of your article.
- `description`: A brief description of your article.
- `slug`: A unique identifier for your article, used in the URL. (it will be verified in the PR review)
- `date`: The date of publication in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `author`: Your name.
- `github`: Your GitHub username, which will be used to fetch your avatar.

```markdown title="example frontmatter"

### Content

After the frontmatter, you can write your article content in Markdown format. Use headings, lists, code blocks, and other Markdown features to structure your content effectively.

#### Images

Images can be added to the article folder and referenced in the Markdown content using the relative path. For example, if you have an image named `image.png` in the same folder as your article, you can include it like this:

```markdown title="example image reference"
![Image](./image.png)
```

![Image](./image.png)

Happy writing!
