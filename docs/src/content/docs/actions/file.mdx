## Open file

To open a file in the editor, use the `open` action. The `open` action takes a file `path` as an argument.

<Tabs syncKey="file-open-action">
<TabItem label="JSON">

```json
{
  "action": "open",
  "path": "<relative path to the file>"
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="YAML">

```yaml
action: open
path: <relative path to the file>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Create file

To create a new file in the editor, use the `create` action. The `create` action takes a file `path` as an argument and optionally a `content` or `contentPath` argument.

<Tabs syncKey="file-create-action">
<TabItem label="JSON">

```json
{
  "action": "create",
  "path": "<relative path to the file>",
  "content": "<content of the file> (optional)",
  "contentPath": "<relative path to the file (optional)"
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="YAML">

```yaml
action: create
path: <relative path to the file>
content: <content of the file> # optional
contentPath: <relative path to the file> # optional
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `content` argument is used to define th content of the file. It is best used when it is a single line of text.

When you want to create a file with a large content, you can use the `contentPath` argument. The `contentPath` argument is used to define the path to the file in the `.demo` folder. The content of the file will be read from the file in the `.demo` folder and used as the content of the file to be created.
