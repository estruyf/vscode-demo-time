In the [getting started](/getting-started/) guide, you learned how to initialize the extension with a sample demo. In this guide, you will learn how to add your demos to the demo time configuration.

<Aside type="note" title="How demo steps work">
  Each <b>demo</b> can contain multiple <b>steps</b>. When you trigger a demo, <b>all its steps will run automatically in sequence</b>—you do not need to trigger each step one by one. This is useful for automating multi-step tasks, such as:
  <ul>
    <li>Creating a new file, adding content, and highlighting code—all in a single demo.</li>
    <li>Opening GitHub Copilot chat, sending a message, and pressing Enter, as one seamless flow.</li>
  </ul>
  Instead of creating separate demos for each action, group related steps together for a smoother, more automated presentation.
</Aside>

## Adding your first demo

Now that you have initialized the extension, you can start adding your first demo steps.

You can open the newly created `demo.json` file in the `.demo` folder manually, or you can click on the "eye" icon in the **Demo Time** view to open the demo steps editor.

<Aside type="tip">
It is a good practice to split your demos into multiple files. This way, you can keep your demos organized and easier to maintain.
</Aside>

The default content of the `demo.json` file looks like this:

<Tabs syncKey="demo-file-format">
<TabItem label="JSON">

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://demotime.show/demo-time.schema.json",
  "title": "Demo",
  "description": "Demo description",
  "version": 2,
  "timer": 5, // Optional timer in minutes. You can also set it on global level with the `demoTime.timer` setting.
  "demos": []
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="YAML">

```yaml
title: Demo
description: Demo description
version: 2
timer: 5 # Optional timer in minutes. You can also set it on global level with
demos: []
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can start adding your demos in the `demos` array. Each demo should have the following structure:

<Tabs syncKey="demo-structure">
<TabItem label="JSON">

```json
{
  "title": "<title>",
  "description": "<description>",
  "steps": []
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="YAML">

```yaml
title: <title>
description: <description>
steps: []
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Aside type="note">
A single demo can contain multiple steps, which will be executed one after another when you trigger the demo. This allows you to automate a sequence of actions as part of a single demo, making your presentations smoother and more efficient.
</Aside>

You can also add icons to the demo to make them more recognizable.

<Tabs syncKey="demo-icons">
<TabItem label="JSON">

```json
{
  "title": "<title>",
  "description": "<description>",
  "version": 2,
  "icons": {
    "start": "<name of the icon (optional)>",
    "end": "<name of the icon (optional)>"
  },
  "steps": []
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="YAML">

```yaml
title: <title>
description: <description>
version: 2
icons:
  start: <name of the icon (optional)>
  end: <name of the icon (optional)>
steps: []
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Aside type="note">
Use the icon names you can find in the [icon listing](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/icons-in-labels#icon-listing) from the Visual Studio Code documentation.
</Aside>

### Sample demo file configuration

Here is an example of a demo where you create a file and open it:

<Tabs syncKey="demo-example">
<TabItem label="JSON">

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://demotime.show/demo-time.schema.json",
  "title": "Demo",
  "description": "Demo description",
  "version": 2,
  "demos": [
    {
      "title": "Create and open sample.json",
      "description": "Create a sample.json file with some content.",
      "icons": {
        "start": "file-code",
        "end": "pass-filled"
      },
      "steps": [
        {
          "action": "create",
          "path": "sample.json",
          "content": "{\n  \"firstName\": \"Elio\",\n  \"lastName\": \"Struyf\"\n}"
        },
        {
          "action": "open",
          "path": "sample.json"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="YAML">

```yaml
title: Demo
description: Demo description
version: 2
demos:
  - title: Create and open sample.json
    description: Create a sample.json file with some content.
    icons:
      start: file-code
      end: pass-filled
    steps:
      - action: create
        path: sample.json
        content: "{\n  \"firstName\": \"Elio\",\n  \"lastName\": \"Struyf\"\n}"
      - action: open
        path: sample.json
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Aside type="note">
Notice the `steps` array in the demo. Each step will be executed in sequence when you trigger the demo. In this example, when the `Create and open sample.json` demo is triggered, it creates a `sample.json` file with the specified content and then opens it in the editor all in one go.
</Aside>

## Adding demo steps

When you have a file open in the editor, you can add a demo step to your demo file by using the command **Demo Time: Add demo step**.

For example, if you want to highlight a piece of code, you can select the code and do the following:

1. Open the command palette by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>.
2. Search for the **Demo Time: Add demo step** command.
3. Click on the `highlight` action in the command palette.
  <Image class="mx-auto" src={demoStepImage} alt="Add a demo step from the &quot;Demo Time: Add demo step&quot; command" />
4. Select the demo file in which you want to add the step (only if you have multiple demo files).
5. Select if you want to add it to an existing demo or create a new one.

## Executing the demo

Each demo you add will be available in the **Demo Time** view. You can execute each step by clicking on the demo title or starting the presentation mode.

<Image class="mx-auto" src={implementationImage} alt="First demo implementation" width="400" />

## Adding notes to your demos

You are also able to add notes to your demos. These notes can be used to provide additional information for yourself or others who will be executing the demo.

The notes should be created as a markdown file in the `.demo` folder. Here is an example of how you can add notes to your demo:

<Tabs syncKey="demo-notes">
<TabItem label="JSON">

```json
{
  "title": "<title>",
  "description": "<description>",
  "version": 2,
  "steps": [...],
  "notes": {
    "path": "<relative path to the file>",
    "showOnTrigger": "<show notes on trigger (optional) - default is false>"
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="YAML">

```yaml
title: <title>
description: <description>
version: 2
steps: [...]
notes:
  path: <relative path to the notes file>
  showOnTrigger: <show notes on trigger (optional) - default is false>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Implementing other demos and steps

You can add more demos and steps to the `demos` array. In the [actions section](/actions/) of the documenation, you can find all the available actions you can use to create your demos.

<Aside type="note">
If you want to split your demos in multiple sections, you can do this by creating multiple demo files in the `.demo` folder. The extension will automatically recognize them and display them in the **Demo Time** view.
