Demo Time has a beta version or pre-release version available from the Visual Studio Code marketplace. This version is used to test new features and fixes before they are released in the stable version.

## Version numbers

The versioning strategy for the main and beta versions is as follows:

- The main version will have version numbers like: `1.1.0`, `1.2.0`, etc.
- The beta version will have version numbers like: `1.1.<build number>`, `1.2.<build number>`, etc.

## How to install the beta version

To install the beta version, you need to tell Visual Studio Code to install the pre-release version. You can do this as follows:

- Open the extension panel in Visual Studio Code.
- Search for "Demo Time" in the search bar.
- Click on the extension in the list.
- Click on the `Switch to Pre-Release Version` button in the extension details view.
  <Image class="mx-auto" src={preReleaseImg} alt="Install pre-release version"  />
- Once you clicked on the button the beta/pre-release version will be installed.
