Demo Time provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server via the [`@demotime/mcp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@demotime/mcp) package. This enables AI assistants and other MCP-compatible clients to search and interact with your Demo Time documentation and slides using natural language queries.

## What is the Demo Time MCP server?

The MCP server allows:
- Searching through Demo Time documentation with natural language
- Automating actions in Demo Time (e.g., opening files, running steps)
- Integrating with AI assistants and tools that support MCP

## How to set up the MCP server

You can run the Demo Time MCP server using `npx`:

```sh
npx -y @demotime/mcp
```

Or, configure it in your MCP host (such as Visual Studio Code) as follows:

1. Create or edit `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "Demo Time": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@demotime/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

2. Reconnect the MCP server in your MCP-compatible tool (e.g., VS Code Copilot Chat).
3. Once connected, you can ask GitHub Copilot or other AI assistants to search the Demo Time documentation for answers.
