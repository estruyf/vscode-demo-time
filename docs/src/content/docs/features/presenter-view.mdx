When you use two screens during a presentation, you can use the detachable presenter view which you can move to another screen. This way you can keep an eye on the next steps while presenting without showing it to your audience.

Follow these steps to use the presenter view:

- Run the `Demo Time: Show presenter view` command to open the presenter view.
- The presenter view will open in detached mode. If that is not the case, you can drag tab out of the Visual Studio Code window.
- Once detached, you can move it to another screen.

The advantage of using the presenter view is that you can see the [notes](/features/using-notes/) and the next steps while presenting.
