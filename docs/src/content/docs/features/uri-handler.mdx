You can trigger a demo from clicking on a link in your website, presentation, etc. To do this, you can make use of the Demo Time its URI handler feature. 

## URI handler

The URI handler is a feature that allows you to trigger a demo by clicking on a link. You can use the `vscode://` protocol to trigger a demo.

To trigger a demo, you need to use the following URI:

```plaintext
vscode://eliostruyf.vscode-demo-time
```

You can make use of the following commands:

- `next`: Go to the next step.
- `runbyid`: Run a specific step by its ID.

### next

To start or trigger the next step, you can use the following URI:

```plaintext
vscode://eliostruyf.vscode-demo-time?command=next
```

Here is an example of how you can use this in a link:

```html
<a href="vscode://eliostruyf.vscode-demo-time?command=next">
  Next
</a>
```

### runbyid

To run a specific step by its ID, you can use the following URI:

```plaintext
vscode://eliostruyf.vscode-demo-time?command=runbyid&id=<demo id>
```

<Aside>
  The `id` parameter is the ID of the step you want to run. You can define this ID in your demo configuration.

Here is an example of how you can use this in a link:

```html
<a href="vscode://eliostruyf.vscode-demo-time?command=runbyid&id=demo1">
  Run step 1
</a>
```
