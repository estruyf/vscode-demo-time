> **Note**: Demo Time works not only in Visual Studio Code, but also in any code editor built on top of Visual Studio Code (such as Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Codespaces, and other VS Code derivatives).

To get started with Demo Time, you need to install the extension in Visual Studio Code. You can find the extension in the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eliostruyf.vscode-demo-time).

You can install the extension via the following link:

<LinkButton
  href="vscode:extension/eliostruyf.vscode-demo-time"
  title={`Install the extension`}
>
  Install the extension
</LinkButton>

Or you can search for "Demo Time" in the extensions panel in Visual Studio Code.

## Initialize the extension

Once you have installed the extension, it is time to initialize it in your project where you want to use it. You can do this by opening the explorer panel in Visual Studio Code. There should be a **Demo Time** view available in which you find the **Initialize** button.

<Image
  class="mx-auto"
  src={initializeImage}
  alt="Initialize Demo Time"
  width="400"
/>

Once you clicked on the **Initialize** button, the extension will create a `.demo` folder in your workspace with a `demo.json` file.

<Aside type="tip">
  You can change the `demo.json` filename to any other name you prefer. The
  extension will still recognize it. You can also create multiple files if you
  want to split your demos.

## Typical flow of a Demo Time session

1. Script your demo steps (in one or more demo files)
2. Mix code walkthroughs with slides — all in VS Code (if you want or use PowerPoint, Keynote, etc. for your slides)
3. Test out the flow
4. Use `presentation mode` to automatically advance (vs clicking manually) with the keyboard shortcuts (`→`) or right arrow on your clicker
5. Stay focused while Demo Time handles the flow

<Aside type="tip" title="How demo steps work">
  Each <b>demo file</b> can contain multiple <b>demos</b>, and each demo can have multiple <b>steps</b>. When you trigger a demo, all its steps will run one after another, automatically and in sequence. This is useful for automating multi-step tasks—such as creating a file, adding content, and highlighting code—all within a single demo. 
  
  Another example: open GitHub Copilot chat, send a message, and trigger the Enter key as a single, seamless flow.

## Think like a presenter, not just a developer

Demo Time works best when you think of your presentation as a **journey**:

- What do you want the audience to feel or understand?
- Where should you pause, explain, highlight, or run code?
- What steps are *essential* vs *supporting*?
