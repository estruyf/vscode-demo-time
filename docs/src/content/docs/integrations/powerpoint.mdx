## Features

- Maintain audience engagement by keeping everything inside your presentation.

## Installation

1. Open PowerPoint.
2. Go to **Home** > **Add-ins**.
3. Search for **Demo Time**.
4. Click **Add** to install the add-in.

Or, install directly from [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA200008736?tab=Overview).

## How to Use

1. **Prepare Your Demo Script**  
   - Prepare your demo(s) and give the ones you want to trigger from PowerPoint an `id` property.
   - Enable the Demo Time API in your Visual Studio Code project by adding the following to your `.vscode/settings.json` file:

      ```json title=".vscode/settings.json"
      {
         "demoTime.api.enabled": true
      }
      ```

2. **Add the Add-in to Your Presentation**  
   - Once installed, you can add the Demo Time add-in from the add-ins menu in PowerPoint.
   - The initial view from the add-in will ask you for the `Demo Time - API URL` and `Demo ID`
      - The `Demo Time - API URL` is the URL of the Demo Time API, which is by default `http://localhost:3710`.
      - The `Demo ID` is the ID of the command you want to trigger from your script.
      - Click on `save` to save the settings and the current slide ID. Important to note is that when you change the slide order, you will have to save the settings of the add-in again.
      - You can test out the demo ID by clicking on the `test` button.

3. **Trigger Live Demos**  
   - Once you go to presentation mode in PowerPoint and you reach the slide with the Demo Time add-in, it will automatically trigger the demo associated with the command ID you set.

4. **Go back to PowerPoint**  
   - After the demo is finished, you can return to your PowerPoint presentation by using the `openPowerPoint` action from Demo Time. This action allows you to seamlessly switch back to your slides without any interruptions.
