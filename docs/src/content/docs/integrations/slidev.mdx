[Slidev](https://sli.dev) is a presentation tool with which you write your slides in markdown and render these in a website.

<Aside type="note">
  Slidev aims to provide flexibility and interactivity for **developers** to make their presentations much more interesting, expressive, and attractive by using technologies they are familiar with. Slidev is also open source with a strong community.

It is a perfect companion for Demo Time when you want to present your slides, and trigger your demos from the slides.

In this guide, you will learn how to integrate Slidev with Demo Time.

## Prerequisites

Before you start integrating Slidev with Demo Time, make sure you have the following:

- A [Slidev](https://sli.dev) presentation
- A Demo Time extension installed in Visual Studio code

## Enable the Demo Time API

First, you need to enable the Demo Time API in your project. To do this, you need to add the configuration to your `.vscode/settings.json` file.

<Code code={`{
    "demoTime.api.enabled": true
}`} 
  lang="json" 
  title={`.vscode/settings.json`} />

<Aside type="tip">
  With the `demoTime.api.port` setting you can specify the port on which the API will run. By default, it is set to `3710`.
</Aside>

Once enabled, it shows the API and its port number in the status bar of Visual Studio Code.

## Install the Demo Time Slidev Addon

To integrate Slidev with Demo Time, you need to install the Demo Time Slidev Addon.

To install the Demo Time Slidev Addon, run the following command:

<Code code={`npm install slidev-addon-demotime`} lang="bash" />

In your `slides.md` file from Slidev, add the `slidev-addon-demotime` addon to the front matter section to import the Demo Time Slidev Addon:

<Code code={`---
addons:
    - slidev-addon-demotime
---`} lang="markdown"  title={`slides.md`} />

## Usage

After you have installed the Demo Time Slidev Addon, you can use the following syntax in your Slidev slides to trigger a demo:

<Code code={`---
clicks: 1
---

# Slide with a demo trigger

This slide triggers \`demo1\` after **1** click.

<demotime click="1" id="demo1" />`} lang="markdown"  title={`slides.md`} />

On a slide where you use the `demotime` component, you will see the Demo Time logo.

<Image class="mx-auto" src={slidevDemoTimeImg} alt="A Slidev slide with the Demo Time trigger" width="600" />

When you hover over the `demotime` component, you will see the ID to trigger. When you click on it, it triggers the demo manually.

<Image class="mx-auto" src={demoIdImg} alt="ID to execute" width="400" />

### Component attributes

The `demotime` component has the following attributes:

- `click`: The number of clicks to trigger the demo.
- `id`: The demo ID to trigger.
- `port`: The port where the Demo Time server is running. Default is `3710`.
- `host`: The host where the Demo Time server is running. Default is `http://localhost`.
- `image`: The image to show in the slide. Default is the Demo Time logo.
