## Highlights

- **Improved slide loading** when switching between demo and slides ([#199](https://github.com/estruyf/vscode-demo-time/issues/199)). Switching between your scripted demo and slides is now much smoother, making live presentations more reliable and seamless.

- **New `openTerminal` action** ([#204](https://github.com/estruyf/vscode-demo-time/issues/204)). You can now open a terminal as part of your demo steps, making it easier to automate and script terminal-based workflows. Learn more in the [actions reference](/actions/terminal).

- **`hacker-typer` typing mode** ([#205](https://github.com/estruyf/vscode-demo-time/issues/205)). Add drama to your demos! The new `hacker-typer` mode for `insert`, `replace`, and `patch` actions simulates fast, cinematic typing. See [text actions documentation](/actions/text#typing-modes) for usage and examples.

- **GitHub Copilot chat improvements** ([#207](https://github.com/estruyf/vscode-demo-time/issues/207)). The `message` property is now optional for Copilot chat actions, making it easier to open a chat panel or start a session without sending an initial message. See [Copilot actions documentation](/actions/copilot).

- **Smarter JSON schema and intellisense** ([#208](https://github.com/estruyf/vscode-demo-time/issues/208)). The JSON schema has been refactored to provide intellisense per action, showing which properties are required and which are optional. This makes authoring demo files in VS Code much easier.

- **`path` property is not required anymore for `unselect`** ([#209](https://github.com/estruyf/vscode-demo-time/issues/209)). You no longer need to specify a path when unselecting text, simplifying your demo steps. See [text actions documentation](/actions/text#unselect-text).

- **`description` property is now optional on the demo root** ([#211](https://github.com/estruyf/vscode-demo-time/issues/211)). This gives you more flexibility when structuring your demo files.

- **Fixes and improvements**:
  - Fixed encoding issue with ampersands in the `dt-list` component ([#212](https://github.com/estruyf/vscode-demo-time/issues/212)).
  - Fixed highlighting of whole lines when using line number and character positioning ([#217](https://github.com/estruyf/vscode-demo-time/issues/217)). See [highlighting tips](/tips/highlighting).

- **New `/api/demos` endpoint** ([#218](https://github.com/estruyf/vscode-demo-time/issues/218)). Retrieve the list of all demos in your workspace programmatically. See the [API documentation](/references/api).
