## Highlights

- **GUI for editing demo files** ([#219](https://github.com/estruyf/vscode-demo-time/issues/219))
  - You can now edit your demo files visually, making it easier to create and update demos without
    manually editing JSON or YAML.

- **Set a title for the `waitForInput` action**
  ([#220](https://github.com/estruyf/vscode-demo-time/issues/220))
  - Add a custom title to the wait-for-input step for clearer instructions during presentations.

- **Auto-advance slides and demos** ([#221](https://github.com/estruyf/vscode-demo-time/issues/221))
  - Use the new `autoAdvanceAfter` property in slide front matter to automatically move to the next
    slide or demo after a set time.

- **Disable demos or steps** ([#222](https://github.com/estruyf/vscode-demo-time/issues/222))
  - You can now disable entire demos or individual steps, making it easy to skip parts of your
    presentation.

- **GUI for editing all settings** ([#225](https://github.com/estruyf/vscode-demo-time/issues/225))
  - Edit all Demo Time settings from a user-friendly interface.

- **New `runDemoById` action** ([#226](https://github.com/estruyf/vscode-demo-time/issues/226))
