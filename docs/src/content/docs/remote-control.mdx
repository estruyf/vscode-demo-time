The Remote Control feature lets you drive your Demo Time presentations from another device (phone,
tablet, second laptop). It connects over your local network or a reachable host where the Demo Time
local API is running.

Open the control at: [remote.demotime.show](https://remote.demotime.show)

<Aside type="tip">
  You can make use of `ngrok` or a reverse proxy to expose the API over the internet to make the Remote Control feature accessible from anywhere.
