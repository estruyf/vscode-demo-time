When you are done with your slides, you can export them to PDF. This is useful for sharing your slides with others or for printing them.
You can export your slides using the `Demo Time: Export slides to PDF` command in Visual Studio Code. This will generates a PDF file in the root of your project with the name `demotime.export.pdf`.

The export feature makes use of the `playwright-chromium` package, which you are required to install locally. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
npm install playwright-chromium -D
```

If this package is not installed, the export command will not work and it will show you the instructions to install it.
