Demo Time is more than just a tool for live demosâ€”it also lets you present slides seamlessly within your editor. With Markdown-based slides, you can deliver presentations without switching between different applications, ensuring a smooth transition between your slides and demos.

## Creating slides

To create slides, start by creating a new Markdown file and adding your content:

```md
---
theme: default
---

# Title

Hello, **Demo Time**!
```

You can also create multiple slides within the same Markdown file by separating them with three hyphens (`---`). This is useful for grouping related slides together. For example:

```md
---
theme: default
---

# Slide 1 Title

Content for the first slide.

---

# Slide 2 Title

Content for the second slide.
```

<Aside type="tip">
When using **grouped slides**, each slide will inherit the following properties from the front matter of the first slide:
- `theme`
- `customTheme`
- `transition`
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
To make the process easier, you can use the `Demo Time: Create a slide` command. This command will start the slide creation process where you will be asked for a title and if you want to add it to any of your demos.
</Aside>

## Slide settings

You can customize your slides using the following properties in the front matter:

- `theme` - Specify the theme for the slide.
- `layout` - Choose a layout for the slide.
- `transition` - Set the transition effect for the slide.
- `image` - Set a background image for the slide.
- `customTheme` - Provide a custom CSS file for the slide.
- `customLayout` - Specify a custom layout for the slide.

### Themes

Personalization matters! Demo Time allows you to customize the look and feel of your slides by selecting a built-in theme or creating your own.

To change your slide theme, you can specify a different theme in the slide configuration with the `theme` property or provide a custom CSS file in the demo JSON file.

Demo Time has the following built-in themes:

- `default`
- `minimal`
- `monomi`
- `unnamed`

<Aside>
More information on theming can be found in the [themes section](/slides/themes/) of the documentation.

### Layouts

Demo Time supports various slide layouts, with the `layout` property, to help structure your presentation effectively:

- `default` - A standard slide layout
- `intro` - Ideal for opening slides
- `quote` - Perfect for displaying key takeaways or citations
- ... (more layouts available)

<Aside>
More information on using layouts can be found in the [layouts section](/slides/layouts/) of the documentation.
</Aside>

### Transitions

Transitions add a dynamic touch to your slides. You can specify the transition effect for your slides using the `transition` property. Demo Time supports various transitions, including:

- `fadeIn`
- `slideRight`
- `slideLeft`
- `slideUp`
- `slideDown`
- `zoomIn`
- `zoomOut`
- `rotateIn`
- `rotateOut`

<Aside type="tip">
You can change the transition effect duration by setting the `--demotime-transition-duration` CSS variable in your custom CSS file.
</Aside>

## Slide preview

When you create a slide, you can preview it by running the `Demo Time: Open slide preview` command or by clicking on the open preview (eye) action from the editor title bar.

## Presenting slides

To incorporate slides into your demo workflow, add them as demo steps in your demo script or configuration files. This ensures you can control when and where your slides appear during the presentation.

Use the `openSlide` action to open a slide in the slide view.

<Tabs syncKey="open-slide">
<TabItem label="JSON">

```json
{
  "action": "openSlide",
  "path": "<relative path to the file>"
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="YAML">

```yaml
action: openSlide
path: <relative path to the file>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

With this approach, you can seamlessly integrate slides into your demos, making your presentations more engaging and dynamic.

## Slide controls

When presenting slides, you have the following control available:
