import { Aside, Code, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import imageRightImg from "../../../../assets/docs/slide-layouts/image-right.webp";

The `image-right` layout is similar to the `image` layout but with the image on the right side, and the content on the left side.

```md
---
layout: image-right
image: "<url to the image>"
---

# Image right slide

This is an image right slide.
```

<Image class="mx-auto" src={imageRightImg} alt="Image right" />
