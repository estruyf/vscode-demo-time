import { Aside, Code, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import imageImg from "../../../../assets/docs/slide-layouts/image.webp";

The `image` layout is used to display an image on the slide. It provides a large image area and a smaller content area.

```md
---
layout: image
image: "<url to the image>"
---
```

<Image class="mx-auto" src={imageImg} alt="Image" />
