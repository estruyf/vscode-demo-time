On this page you can find the list of built-in slide layouts available in Demo Time. These layouts can be used to structure your slides effectively.

By default, the slide uses the `default` layout, but you can change it per slide by providing the layout name in the front matter section of the slide:

```md
---
layout: intro
---

# Welcome to Demo Time!
```

- [Default](/slides/layouts/default/)
