## Custom themes

You can also create your own custom themes by providing a CSS file to the `demoTime.customTheme` setting or to the `customTheme` property in the front matter section of your slide. This allows you to customize the look and feel of your slides to match your brand or style.

### Create a custom theme

Start from one of the built-in themes, and customize the CSS to match your style.

```css title=".demo/slides/theme.css"
body {
  background: black;
  color: white;
}

.intro {
  h1 {
    font-size: 2em;
    font-style: italic;
  }
}
```

<Aside type="tip">
Each theme also has a predefined set of CSS variables that you can use to customize the theme. The list of CSS variables can be found in the specific theme documentation page.
</Aside>

### Apply the custom theme globally

To apply the custom theme globally, you can provide the CSS file in the `demoTime.customTheme` setting in your `.vscode/settings.json` file:

```json title=".vscode/settings.json"
{
  "demoTime.customTheme": ".demo/slides/theme.css"
}
```

### Apply the custom theme on a single slide

To apply the custom theme, you can provide the CSS file in the slide's frontmatter section with the `customTheme` property:

```md title=".demo/slides/slide.md"
---
customTheme: .demo/slides/theme.css
---

# Welcome to Demo Time!
```

<Image class="mx-auto" src={customThemeImg} alt="Custom theming" />

<Aside type="note">
If you do not specify a `theme` in the front matter, the `default` theme will be used.
