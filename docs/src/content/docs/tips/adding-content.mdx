When you want to insert content to a file, you can use the `content` or `contentPath` properties in the demo step.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `content` | This property allows you to add the content directly in the JSON file, but this can make your JSON file quite big and it can be hard to read. |
| `contentPath` | This property allows you to reference a file in the `.demo` folder. This way you can keep your JSON file clean and add the content in separate files. **Important**: the path is relative to the `.demo` folder. |

## Using the `content` property

When you use the `content` property, you can add the content directly in the JSON file. This property is best used when you want to add a single line of text.

<TabItem label="JSON">

```json
{
  "action": "insert",
  "path": "src/content/docs/tips/adding-content.mdx",3
  "position": "end",
  "content": "Learn how to add content to a file in Demo Time."
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="YAML">

```yaml
action: insert
path: "src/content/docs/tips/adding-content.mdx"
position: end
content: "Learn how to add content to a file in Demo Time."
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Aside type="tip">
When you want to add a large content, it is best to use the `contentPath` property. This way you can keep your JSON file clean and add the content in separate files.
</Aside>

## Using the `contentPath` property

When you use the `contentPath` property, you can reference a file in the `.demo` folder. This way you can keep your JSON file clean and add the content in separate files.

<Aside type="caution">
The indentation of the file will be preserved when you insert the content. This means that you have to be careful with the indentation of the content you add.

You can add an `executeVSCodeCommand` action with the `editor.action.reindentlines` command to reindent the content. 
</Aside>

## Add a line by line insertion delay

You also have the option to define the speed of each line that is inserted. You can define this on global level with the `demoTime.lineInsertionDelay` setting or on a per step level with the `insertTypingSpeed` property.

<Aside type="note">
By default the `insertTypingSpeed` is set to `25`, which means that the content will be inserted immediately.
