When you want to add new steps to a demo, you can do this manually, or use the `Demo Time: Add new action to demo step` command when you have the demo file open in the editor. The command is also available as a trigger via the `+` icon in the editor title bar.

When you use the command, it asks you to select the action you want to add and if you want to add it to an existing demo or a new one. Once you have selected the action, the action template will be added to the demo file.
