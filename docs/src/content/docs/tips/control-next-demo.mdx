By default, the `right` arrow key is bound to the `demo-time.start` command when you are in presentation mode. This means that pressing the `right` arrow key will trigger the next slide/demo/step. To gain more control over when to continue to the next demo during a presentation, you can configure your own conditions on when to run the `demo-time.start` command based on the context.

For example: when you are on the slide view, you want to use the `right` arrow key to advance the next step, but when you are in the code view, you want to use `cmd+shift+right` to run the next demo elsewhere.

You can achieve this by defining your own keybinding in the `keybindings.json` file. Hereâ€™s how you can configure it:

- Open the command palette (Cmd+Shift+P or Ctrl+Shift+P) and type `Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)` (`workbench.action.openGlobalKeybindingsFile`) to open the `keybindings.json` file.
- Add the following configuration to your `keybindings.json` file:

```json
[
  {
    "key": "right",
    "command": "demo-time.start",
    "when": "demo-time.presentation && activeWebviewPanelId == demoTime:preview"
  },
  {
    "key": "cmd+shift+right",
    "command": "demo-time.start",
    "when": "demo-time.presentation && activeWebviewPanelId != demoTime:preview"
  },
  {
    "key": "right",
    "command": "-demo-time.start",
    "when": "demo-time.presentation"
  }
]
```

### Explanation

1. **First Rule**: The `right` arrow key triggers `demo-time.start` only when you are on the slides (`activeWebviewPanelId == demoTime:preview`).
2. **Second Rule**: The `cmd+shift+right` keybinding triggers `demo-time.start` when you are outside the slides (`activeWebviewPanelId != demoTime:preview`) and allows you to use the `right` arrow key to navigate through your code or other content.
3. **Third Rule**: Removes the default `right` arrow keybinding for `demo-time.start` to avoid conflicts.
