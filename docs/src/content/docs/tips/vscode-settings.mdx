In addition to the [Demo Time VS Code settings](/references/settings/) there are a number of settings that you may find useful to set in your [VS Code settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/settings#_workspace-settings).

## Terminal Placement
By default VS Code places any new terminal windows at the bottom of the screen. 

When presenting it can be useful to set the default location of new terminal windows to `editor` rather than `view`. This will then create new terminals in an editor tab providing more space.

```json
{
  "terminal.integrated.defaultLocation": "editor"
}
```

## Font Sizes
Demo Time allows you to set the zoom level when highlighting text however it can be useful to set a default font size.

This can be done for both the editor and the terminal independently.

```json
{
  "editor.fontSize": 20,
  "terminal.integrated.fontSize": 25
}
```

## Cursors

By default, Visual Studio Code uses a thin blinking cursor, which can be hard to spot during demos. 

Changing the cursor to a block which expands gives a better visual cue of where the cursor is located.

```json
{
  "editor.cursorStyle": "block",
  "editor.cursorBlinking": "expand"
}
```

You can also give your cursor a different color to make it stand out more. 

```json
{
  "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
    "editorCursor.foreground": "#FF0000"
  }
}
```

## Hover panels

When hovering over code, VS Code shows a hover panel with information about the code. These hover panels can be distracting during demos.

To turn off the hover panels, you can set the following setting:

```json
{
  "editor.hover.enabled": false
}
```
