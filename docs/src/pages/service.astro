      <h1>Stop spending days building demos.</h1>

      <p>
        I must admit, creating great demos can be time-consuming, especially when it's your first
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past two years, I built <strong>Demo Time</strong> to help presenters script, automate,
        and deliver better presentations and demos without the stress. Developers, advocates, and trainers
        are already using it to avoid the classic demo pitfalls: frantic window switching, broken commands,
        tiny fonts, and lost flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        But there was always one missing piece: <strong
          >creating the demo itself still took too much time.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>I decided it was time to change that.</p>
    </header>

    {/* Problem Section */}
    <section>
      <h2>The challenge: why demos take so much time</h2>
      <p>
        When I talk to people who present regularly, they almost always describe the same friction
        points. I know I've felt them myself.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is not just frustration; it is lost time. <strong
          >On average, a high-quality technical demo, can easily take a day or more to build and
          refine.</strong
        > That is a lot of time lost engineering or sales time per demo.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Maintenance:</strong> You update your product or feature, and suddenly the old demo
          no longer works.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Narrative:</strong> You want to tell a clear story, but you aren't sure which commits
          or changes matter most.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Organization:</strong> Your notes are scattered everywhere.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Starting from scratch:</strong> You lack templates, so every demo feels like Day 1.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fine-tuning:</strong> You spend hours tweaking code steps, commands, and highlights.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Anxiety:</strong> The pressure of "will the demo break on stage?" never fully disappears.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Demo Time</strong> solves the <em>delivery</em> part. Now, I want to help solve the <em
          >creation</em
        >
        part.
      </p>
    </section>

    {/* Trust Section */}
    <section>
      <h2>Why demo failures cost more than you think</h2>

      <p>A failed demo isn't just an awkward moment on stage, it damages trust.</p>

      <p>
        When your demo breaks, your audience doesn't just see a technical glitch. They see doubt.
        They question whether your product works as promised. They wonder if you really understand
        what you built. For companies, a single failed demo at a conference can undermine months of
        marketing effort.
      </p>

      <p><strong>The trust equation is simple:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A flawless demo builds confidence in your product and your expertise</li>
        <li>A broken demo creates doubt about both</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This matters whether you're:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A <strong>sales engineer</strong> trying to close a deal (one failed demo can kill the opportunity)
        </li>
        <li>
          A <strong>developer advocate</strong> representing your company at a conference (your credibility
          is on the line)
        </li>
        <li>
          A <strong>product engineer</strong> showcasing a new feature (stakeholders need to trust it
          works)
        </li>
        <li>
          A <strong>teacher</strong> educating students (broken examples destroy learning momentum)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The best demos aren't just technically accurate, they build a trust relationship between you
        (or your company) and your audience. When everything works perfectly, every time, your
        audience focuses on the value you're delivering, not on whether the technology will
        cooperate.
      </p>

      <p>Demo Time ensures your demos work flawlessly, so you can focus on building that trust.</p>

    {/* Solution Section */}
    <section>
      <h2>The solution: Demo Time as a Service</h2>

      <h3>We turn your git commits into presentation-ready demos.</h3>

      <p>Here's how it works:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Share your repository</strong> and tell us the story you want to tell</li>
        <li><strong>We analyze your commits</strong> and generate a Demo Time script</li>
        <li>
          <strong>You present with confidence</strong>, no typos, no broken commands, no stress
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        This is fundamentally different from screen recording tools or generic slide builders.
        Because it is tied to your git history, your demo remains a living part of your codebase,
        not a static artifact that rots the moment you merge a new PR.
      </p>
    </section>

    {/* Requirements Section */}
    <section>
      <h2>Requirements for the Demo Creation Service</h2>

      <p>
        To ensure we can create the best demo for you, your repository should meet these criteria:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Repository must be Git based</li>
        <li>
          Must have meaningful commit messages, with guidelines we provide for clarity and
          consistency
        </li>
        <li>Feature should span 3-20 commits (not 1, not 500)</li>
        <li>We'll need access (public repo or collaborator invite)</li>
        <li>Provide a 1-paragraph description of the story you want to tell</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Don't meet these requirements?</strong> No problem. We can provide guidance on preparing
        your repository, or you can book coaching hours (€ 200/hour) to help you get ready.

    {/* Who Is This For Section */}

        scale:
      </p>

      <ul>

      <p>
        If your organization creates multiple demos and training materials regularly, Demo Time as a
        Service helps you scale your content creation without scaling your headcount.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>Important:</strong> This service is specifically for technical presentations in Visual
          Studio Code (or VS Code-based editors) where you control the repository. It's not designed

    </section>

    {/* Benefits Section */}
    <section>
      <h2>Why Demo Time?</h2>

      <p>With Demo Time, your organization gets:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Scalability:</strong> Create 10 demos in the time it used to take for 2, without hiring
          more people
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consistency:</strong> Every demo follows the same professional standards across your
          training materials
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reliability:</strong> No more "works on my machine" disasters during live training
          sessions
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Maintainability:</strong> Your demos live with your code and stay current as your product
          evolves
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Confidence:</strong> Training managers can trust their presenters won't embarrass the
          company with broken demos
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>For training managers:</strong> You're solving two problems at once. Reducing your team's
        workload while eliminating the risk of public demo failures that damage your company's reputation.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>For content creators:</strong> Clone the repository and deliver the same perfect demo
        every time. No fiddling around with manual notes or making sure everything works before you begin.
