# Creating demos

Follow these steps to create your first demo using **Demo Time**:

## Step 1: Create a new demo file

- Open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
- Search for and select `Demo Time: Create a new demo file`.
- You will be prompted to choose a name for your demo file.
- Enter a name (e.g., `my-demo`) and press `Enter`.
- A new `my-demo.json` or `my-demo.yaml` file will be created in the `.demo` folder of your
  workspace, depending on your preferred format.

## Step 2: Add steps to your demo

- Open a file which you want to include in your demo.
- Open the command palette again.
- Search for and select `Demo Time: Add demo step`.
- You will be prompted to choose the action type for the step.
- Select the action type (e.g., `Create`, `Open`, `Insert`, `Delete`).
- Specify if it should be added as a new demo or as a step in an existing demo.

## Step 3: Customize Your Demo

- Add titles, descriptions, and custom icons for each step to make your demo more engaging.
- - Use the created demo file to manually edit or fine-tune your demo steps.
