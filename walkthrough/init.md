# Initialize the project

Welcome to **Demo Time**! Follow these steps to get started:

## Step 1: Open the Demo Time view

- Go to the **Explorer** panel in Visual Studio Code.
- Locate the **Demo Time** view.

> You can also trigger it by executing the [Focus on Demo Time View](command:demo-time.focus)
> command in the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).

## Step 2: Initialize the extension

- Click the **[Initialize](command:demo-time.initialize)** button in the Demo Time view.
- This will create a `.demo` folder in your workspace with a `demo.json` or `demo.yaml` file,
  depending on the format you select.

## Step 3: Verify initialization

- Ensure the `.demo/demo.json` or `.demo/demo.yaml` file is created in your workspace.
- You can now start adding steps to your demo.
